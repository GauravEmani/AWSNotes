Web Application Firewall

Protects your web application from common web exploits (Layer 7)
Layer 7 is HTTP(vs Layer 4 which is TCP/UDP)

Deploy on
  - Application Load Balancer
  - API Gateway
  - CloudFront
  - AppSync GraphQL AP
  - Cognito user pool

Define Web ACL (Web Access Control List) Rules:
  - IP Set uptp 10,000 addresses - use multiple Rules for IP's
  - HTTP header, body, or URI string protects from common attack - SQL injection
  - Size constraints, geo-match (block countries)
  - Rate based rules (avoid getting more than 10 requests from one IP)

WEB ACL are regional except for CloudFront
A rule group is a reusable set of rules thta you can add to a WEB ACL

Scenario: WAF - Fixed IP while using WAF with ALB
  - WAF does not support NLB (WAF operate on Layer 7, hance we use Application Load Balancer which operates on Layer 7)
  - Application load balance does not have fixed IP's (to solve this issue we will use a Global Accelarator for Fixed IP)
  - Now we enable WAF on ALB
  - So the flow would be as below

Users  --> Global Accelerator (Fixed IP)  --> Region --> Application Load Balancer (<--> WAF)  --> EC2 instances
