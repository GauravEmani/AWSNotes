Purpose of transit gateway is to reduce the transitive peering of multiple VPC's and on-premises, hub-and-spoke (star) connection
Transit gateway is a regional resource, can work cross region as well
We can share transit gateway using resource access manager
We can peer transit gateways across regions
Route Tables: limit which VPC can talk with other VPC
Works with Direct Connect Gateway, VPN connections
Supports IP Multicast ( not supported by any other Aws service )

Another Usercase:
Trasit gateway: Site to Site VPN ECMP
ECMP = equal Cost multi-path
Routing strategy to allow to forward a packet over multiple best paths
Use Case: crete multi site to site vpn connections to increase bandwidth of your connection to aws
basically increases throughput
