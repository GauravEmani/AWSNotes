Security Groups and NACL's:

----------------------------

NACL is stateless ( the traffic inbound and outbound will be checked everytime), epemeral ports

NACL are like a firewall which control traffic to and from subnets

One NACL per subnet, new subnets are assigned to Default NACL, so NACL's operate at subnet level

NACL's support both allow and deny rules

You define NACL rules:

               Rules have a number (1 - 32766), higher precedence with lower number (1, 2, 3 etc..)

               First rule match will drive the decision

               Example: if you define #100 ALLOW 10.0.0.10/32 and #200 deny 10.0.0.10/32, the IP address will be allowed because 100 has a higher precedence over 200

               The last rule is an asterisk (*) and denies a request in case of no rule match

               AWS recommends adding rules by increment of 100

              

Newly created NACL will deny everything

Default NACL sitting over subnets will allow everything (inbound/outbound).

 

Security Groups are stateful ( any traffic inbound is automatically allowed outbound)

Operates at instance level

Support allow on rules

 

 

 

Ephemeral Ports:

-----------------

Random port which are assigned just for connection life

Ports are used for any 2 endpoints to establish connection

Clients connect to a defined port and expect a response on an ephemeral port

               - since client does not have any specific port by default, so client opens an ephemeral port to receive the response

Different Operating systems use different port ranges, example

               IANA & MS Windows 10 use the range - 49152 to 65535

               Many Linux Kernels use the range - 32768 to 60999
