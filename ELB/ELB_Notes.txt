Load Balancers are servers that forward traffic to multiple servers (eg: EC2)

Why to use load balancers?
- Spread load across mutiple downstream instances
- Expose a single point of access (DNS) to your application
- Seamlessly handle failures of downstream instances
- Do regular health check of your instances
- Provide SSL termination(HTTTPS) for your websites
- Enforce stickiness with cookies
- High availability across zones
- Separate public traffic from private traffic

Why use Elastic Load Balancer?
- ELB is managed service
- AWS guarentees its working, upgrades, maintenance, HA
- AWS helps provision this with ease
- Alhough it would cost less to setup your load balancer but there would be a lot of effort
- ELB is integrated with many AWS offerings/services
  - Ec2, EC2 Auto Scaling Groups, Amazon ECS, AWS Certicate Manager, CloudWatch, Route 53, AWS WAF, AWS Global Accelerator

Health check:
- Enables the LB to know if the instances its forwading the traffic to is avialable 
- Health check is done on a port and route
  - Protocol: HTTP
  - Port: 4567
  - Endpoint: /health

AWS has 4 types of load balancers:
Classic Load Balancer (v1 - old generation - 2009 - CLB)
  - HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, SSL (secure TCP)
Application Laod Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2016 - ALB)
  - HTTP, HTTPS, Websocket
Network Load Balancer (v2 - new generation - 2017 - NLB)
  - TCP, TLS (Secure TCP, UDP
Gateway Load Balancer - 2020 GWLB
  - Operates at layer 3(Network Layer) - IP Protocol

Elastic load balancers can be setup as internal (private) or externa (public)

Application Load Balancer (Layer 7 - HTTP)
- Load balancing to multiple applications HTTP across machines (target groups)
- Load balancing to multiple application on the same machine(eg:- containers)
- support for http/2 and web sockets
- supports redirects (http to https)
- routing based on path in url (example.com/users and example.com/posts)
- routing based on hostname (one.exmaple.com and other.example.com)
- routing based on Query Strings, Headers (example.com/users?id=233&order=false)
- ALB's are a great fit for microservices and container basd application
- In comparison we would need multiple classic load balancer per application

Advantages:
- fixed hostname (XXX>regios.elb.amazonaws.com)
- Appliction servers dont see the IP of the client directly
  - The true IP of the client is inserted in the header X-Forwaded-For
  - We can also get post(X-Forwaded-Port) and proto(X-Forwaded-Proto)

Network Load Balancers: Layer 4
- Forward TCP and UDP traffic to your instances
- Hande millions of requests per second
- Ultra low latency

NLB has only 1 static IP per AZ  and support assigning Elastic IP, usedful for exposing your application with one IP
(helpful for whitelisting specific IP)
NLB are used for extreme performance TCP and UDP trafic
note: this is not included in free tier

Network Load Balancers target groups:
- Source traffic can be TCP, but NLB can then send traffic to destination as TCP or HTTP
- Target Groups can be EC2 instances
- If target groups are IP Addresses - then they must be private IP's
- Target can be an application load balancer as well - the reason for this would be that we NLB would give us the fixed IP addresses 
since one elastic IP per AZ is dedicated to NLB, and then we can also use the rules of ALB to further divert traffic as per our need
- Heath Checks supported by the network load balancer target groups include TCP, HTTP and HTTPS protocol

Gateway Load Balancers: Operates at Layer 3 Network Layer (IP Packets)
- Deploy scale and manage a fleet of 3rd party netwokr virtual appliances in AWS
- Example: Firewalls, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Ssytem, Deep Packet Inspection Systems, Payload Manipulation
- Gateway load balancer helps analyse the traffic using 3rd party security virual appliances on Network Layer at IP Packets level

Combine the following funcitons:
- Transport Network Gateway: Single entry/exit for all traffic
- Load Balancer: sitribute traffic to your virtual appliances

Uses GENEVE protocol on port 6081


Application Load Balancer (ALB) is the right choice for a web application that requires connection stickiness with duration-based session affinity, as it supports advanced request routing and allows the implementation of sticky sessions using cookies that can be set with a custom expiration period. ALBs are designed to operate at Layer 7 (Application Layer) of the OSI model, which is suitable for HTTP/HTTPS traffic, common in web applications.

The Classic Load Balancer does support sticky sessions, but it is a legacy option and does not offer the advanced routing capabilities of ALBs. Additionally, the Classic Load Balancer operates both at Layer 4 (Transport Layer) and Layer 7, which might not be optimal for the requirements of the question.

Network Load Balancer (NLB) operates at Layer 4 and is optimized for high-performance, low-latency TCP/UDP traffic, generally without the need for advanced request routing based on content. It uses source IP persistence, which is not the same as duration-based session affinity. Thus, NLB would not be the best fit for the specified requirements.

Gateway Load Balancer is designed to distribute traffic to appliances such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems and does not directly cater to session stickiness requirements in the same manner as an Application Load Balancer; hence, it is also not the correct choice for the stipulated scenario.
