VPC Endpoint consists of two types
1. VPC Endpoint Interface
2. VPC Endpoint Gateway

VPC Endpoint Interface:
- Provisions on ENI (Private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a security group)
- Supports most AWS services
- $ per hour + $ per GB usage

VPC Gateway Endpoint:
- Provisions a Gateway and must be used as a target in a route table (does not use security group)
- Supports both S3 and DynamoDb
- Free


What to use?
Gateway most likely prefered solution in exams
Interface Endpoint is preferable over Gateway Endpoint when you need access from on-premises (Site to Site VPN or Direct Connect), a different VPC or a different region)
