VPC Peering

-----------------

Privately connect 2 VPCs using AWS network

Make them behave as if they were in the same network

Must not have overlapping CIDRs

VPC peering is not transitive A - B, B - C then its not A - C, we will have to setup and A - C vpc peering

VPC Peering connection can be made between different VPC's in different AWS accounts/regions

You can reference a security group in a peered VPC (works cross account - same region)

eg: vpc-1234/sg-024f24hvg4hbj2 as source in inbound rules

 

 

Steps to Peer VPC's

1. Go to VPC > Peering connection

2. Give it a name eg:- DemoVPCPeering

3. Select the requestor VPC eg:- VPC1

4.Select another VPC to connect to which is would either be in same account, same region or different

5. Provide the VPC to connect with (acceptor VPC) eg:- VPC 2

6. Add the entry into route table of each VPC1, you will add the CIDR range of VPC2 as Destination and Target as VPC peering connection name - DemoVPCPeering

7. Add an entry to the route table for VPC 2, you will add the CIDR range of VPC 1 as Detination and Target as VPC Peering connection name - DemoVPCPeering

8. This should now allow traffic between both VPC's
