For secure web traffic using Server Name Indication (SNI), the appropriate protocol and port combination is HTTPS on port 443. SNI is an extension of the TLS protocol that allows multiple domains to be hosted on the same IP address with each domain serving its own SSL certificate. Port 443 is the default port for HTTPS traffic, which is the secure version of HTTP, and HTTPS inherently includes the use of TLS for encryption.

The mention of 'SSL on port 443 with SNI mandatory' is slightly incorrect because while the term 'SSL' is commonly used interchangeably with 'TLS', the current and more secure protocol is TLS, and specifically mentioning SSL can imply an outdated or less secure version. Moreover, current practice does not typically differentiate SNI as a 'mandatory' option; it is inherently part of the HTTPS protocol when dealing with name-based virtual hosting.

The option stating 'HTTP on port 443 with TLS termination' is incorrect because HTTP on port 443 is not a standard practice. Secure HTTP traffic is known as HTTPS, and it should be specified as such. TLS termination does imply the use of encryption, but the correct term for the protocol on port 443 is HTTPS, not HTTP.

Lastly, the use of 'TCP on port 443 using SSL certificates' is not as specific as it could be, since HTTPS is the specific application protocol over TCP that uses SSL/TLS for security on port 443. While technically accurate that HTTPS operates over TCP, the mention of 'TCP' alone does not adequately convey that we are discussing web traffic, nor does it specify the use of SNI for that traffic.
