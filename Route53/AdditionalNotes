AWS Route 53:

 

DNS?

 

Domain Name System which translates the human friendly hostnames into machine IP address

example:

www.google.com => 172.217.18.36

DNS is the backbone of the internet

 

Heirarchical naming structure

               .com, example.com, api.example.com

Route 53 is a domain registrar

- how to route traffic

- record contains

               - domain/subdomain

               - record type - A or AAAA

               - value - 12.34.56.78

               - ttl - amount of time record cached at DNS resolvers

- route53 supports following DNS record types

               - (must know) A/AAAA/CNAME/NS

               - (advanced) CAA/DS/MS/NAPTR/PTR/SOA/TXT/SPF/SRV

 

A - maps hostname to IPv4

AAAA - maps hostname to IPv6

CNAME - maps a hostname to another hostname

                              - the target is a domain name which must have an A or AAAA record

                              - Cant create a CNAME record for the top node of a DNS namespace (Zone Apex)

                              - Example: you cannot create a CNAME for example.com but can create for www.example.com

NS - Names Servers for the hosterd Zone, which are the ip addresses which can respond to DNS quesries to the hosted zones

 

What are Hosted Zones?

 

A container for records that define how to route traffic to a domain and its subdomains

 

There are 2 types of hosted zones:

Public Hosted Zones - Contains records that specify thow to route traffic on the internet(public domain names)

application1.mypublicdomain.com

Private Hosted Zones - Contain records that specify how you route traffic within one of more VPCs(private domain names)

application1.companyinternal

TTL ?

High TTL: eg -24hrs

               - Less traffic on route53

               - possibly outdated records

Low TTL: eg - 60 sec

               - More traffic on route 53 (increase in cost)

               - Records are outdated for less time

               - easy to change records

 

TTL is mandatory for each DNS record except the Alias record
