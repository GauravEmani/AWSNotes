- Test systems at production scale
- Automate to make architectural experimentation easier
- Allow for evolutionaly architectures
    - Design based on changing Architecture
- Drive Architectures using data
- Improve through game days
  - flash sale days

**6 pillars of Well Architected Framework**
1. Operational Excellence
2. Security
3. Reliability
4. Perfomance Efficiency
5. Cost Optimzation
6. Sustainability
