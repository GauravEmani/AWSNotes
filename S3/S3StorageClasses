S3 Storage Classes:
  - S3 Standard - General Purpose
  - S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA)
  - S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access
  - S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval
  - Glacier lexible Retrieval
  - Glacier Deep Archive
  - Intelligent Tiering

We can move objects between these classes manually or using S3 lifecycle configurations

Durability: 
- High Durability (99.99999999999, 11 9's) of the objects across multiple AZ's
- If you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, then on an average you can expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years
- Same for all types of storage classes

Availability:
- Measure how readily available a service is
- Varies depending on storage class
- Example: S3 standard has 99.99% availability, this means that it will not be available for 53 minutes in a year

S3 Standard - General Purpose:
- 99.99% availability
- used for frequently accessed data
- low latency and high throughput
- can sustain 2 concurrent facility failures

User Cases: Big Data Analytics, mobile and gaming applications , content distribution...

S3 Infrequent Access:
- For data that is less frequently accessssed, but requires rapid access when needed
- Lower cost than S3 standard

Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard - IA)
- 99.9% availabilty
- Use Cases: Disaster Recovery, backups

Amazon S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA)
- High Durability (99.999999999% in a single AZ; data lost when AZ is destroyed
- 99.5% avialability
- Use Cases: Storing secondary backup copies of on-premise data, or data you can recreate

S3 Glacier Storage Classes:
- Low cost object storage meant for archiving/backup
- pricing: price for storage + price for data retrieval

Amazon S3 Glacier Instanct Retrieval:
- millisecs retrieval, great for data accessed once a quarter
- minimum storage duration is of 90 days

Amazon S3 Glacier Flexibel Retrieval:
- Expedited (1 - 5 mins), Standard(3 - 5 hours), Bulk( 5 - 12 hours) -free
- minimum storage duration is of 90 days

Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive Retrieval - for long term storage:
- Standard (12 hours), Bulk(48 hours)
- minimum storage duration is of 90 days

S3 Intelligent Tiering:
- Small monthly monitoring and auto-tiering fee
- Moves objects automatically between Access Tiers based on usage
- There are no retrieval charges in S3 intelligent-tiering

Following classes can be configured as part of intelligent tiering:

- frequent access tier(automatic): defuat tier
- infrequent access tier(automatic): objects not accessed for 30days
- archive instant access tier(automatic): objects not accessed for 90 days
- archive access tier (optional): configurable from 90 days to 700+ days
- deep arhcive access tier (optional): configurable from 180 days to 700+ days
