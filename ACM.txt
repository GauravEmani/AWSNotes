1. List domain names to be included in the certificate
  - FQDN :(example - corp.example.com)
  - Wildcard Domain - *.example.com
2. Select the Validation method : DNS Validation or Email validation
  - DNS Validation is preferred for automation purposes
  - Email validation will send emails to contact addresses in WHOIS database
  - DNS validation will leverage a CNAME record to DNS config (ex:Route53)

4. The public certificate will be enrolled for automatic renewal
  - ACM automatically renews ACM generated certificates 60 days before expiry
