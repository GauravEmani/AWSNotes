VPC Endpoint consists of two types
1. VPC Endpoint Interface
2. VPC Endpoint Gateway

VPC Endpoint Interface:
- Provisions on ENI (Private IP address) as an entry point (must attach a security group)
- Supports most AWS services
- $ per hour + $ per GB usage

VPC Gateway Endpoint:
- Provisions a Gateway and must be used as a target in a route table (does not use security group)
- Supports both S3 and DynamoDb
- Free


What to use?
Gateway most likely prefered solution in exams
Interface Endpoint is preferable over Gateway Endpoint when you need access from on-premises (Site to Site VPN or Direct Connect), a different VPC or a different region)

More Notes
Service on AWS such as dynamodb or S3 are accessible via internet

VPC endpoint allows you to access the resources which are accessible publicly or via internet, privately without having to go to the internet via NAT Gateway and then connect to the AWS resource such as dynamodb or S3

Every AWS Service is publicy exposed (public URL) and connecting to a resource privately via VPC endpoint ensures that the traffic does not leave the VPC. They remove the need of IGW, NATGW.. to access the resource. Eg: EC2(private subnet) -> NATGW -> IGW -> SQS/SNS
